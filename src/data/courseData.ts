Because if you misunderstand what Infracodebase is, you might think it is simply a tool that generates infrastructure code. But that is not the full picture. Infracodebase is designed as an agent operating system for infrastructure as code. That means it is not just generating code. It gives you an environment where you can design, build, review, and operate infrastructure with the help of AI agents. Understanding this changes how you approach Infracodebase. Because instead of thinking: \"this writes Terraform for me\" you start thinking: \"I can work with an agent inside one environment where architecture, code, documentation, and decisions stay connected.\"",

            coreConcepts: "Let's start with something very common in infrastructure work. When you build infrastructure today, you usually use many different tools. For example: one tool to design architecture, another tool to write infrastructure code, another tool to manage Git repositories, another tool to store documentation, another tool to review security, another tool to deploy infrastructure, another tool to visualize diagrams. This creates a fragmented workflow. You move from tool to tool. You copy information between systems. You lose context. Documentation drifts away from the real infrastructure. Architecture decisions get separated from the code. And teams spend more time coordinating tools than designing systems well. This is the problem Infracodebase is trying to solve.\n\nInstead of spreading this work across many tools, Infracodebase brings the pieces together into one connected environment. Inside a workspace you can: design infrastructure, generate infrastructure code, review architecture, collaborate with engineers, connect Git repositories, visualize systems, upload documentation, and track changes over time.\n\nAnd Infracodebase works across multiple cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP. It also supports infrastructure as code languages such as: Terraform, Pulumi, OpenTofu.",

            whyThisMatters: "In real organizations, platform engineers rarely start from a clean, well-designed system. More often, they inherit a platform that has already evolved over time.\n\nThat platform may include:\n\n- rulesets\n- workflows\n- subagents\n- workspace history\n\nAt first glance, everything may appear to work. Infrastructure is being generated. Teams are building systems. But over time, deeper problems begin to appear. Different teams produce different outputs. Security standards are applied inconsistently. Workflows feel unclear or incomplete. Debugging infrastructure changes becomes difficult. At this point, the challenge is no longer building infrastructure. The challenge is understanding and improving a complex, evolving system. This is one of the most important skills in platform engineering. And importantly:\n\n- Most failures are not caused by missing components\n- They are caused by misalignment between components",
            coreConcepts: "Debugging a platform model requires understanding how problems emerge across multiple layers.

Look for: missing rules (e.g. security, tagging, naming), vague rules (e.g. \"use best practices\"), overlapping or conflicting rules. Ask yourself: Do these rulesets produce consistent infrastructure across teams?\n\n**Step 2 — Analyze Process Flow**\nOpen the workflow definitions. Check: does the workflow include validation?\n\n**Step 3 — Inspect Execution Boundaries**\nReview subagents. Look for: unclear responsibilities, overlapping scopes, excessive tool access. Ask yourself: Is each subagent responsible for one clearly defined task?\n\n**Step 4 — Evaluate Traceability**\nOpen the workspace history. Inspect: commit timeline, changes across files, ability to understand system evolution. Ask yourself: Can you explain how the system reached its current state? If not, traceability is insufficient.\n\n**Step 5 — Identify Root Causes**\nNow step back.

This step is critical. Do not fix anything yet. Understand the system first.\n\n**Step 6 — Apply Targeted Improvements**\nNow improve the platform model. Make focused changes:\n\n- Refine rulesets to be specific and scoped\n- Add validation steps to workflows\n- Reduce subagent scope and clarify responsibilities\n- Define how history should be used (e.g. milestones, review points)\n\nAs you make changes, observe:\n\n- How ruleset changes affect workflow behavior\n- How workflow changes affect subagent usage\n- How execution changes appear in history\n\nAvoid large redesigns. Make controlled improvements.\n\n**Step 7 — Validate the System**\nAfter applying changes:\n\n- review generated infrastructure\n- verify consistency across teams\n- inspect workflow behavior\n- review history for clarity\n\nThen ask: Is the system now more aligned?
